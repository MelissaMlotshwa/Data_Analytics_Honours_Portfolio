# 💡Data Analytics Honours Portfolio
**📈Driving Strategic Decisions with Advanced Data Analytics**

Welcome to my professional Data Analytics Portfolio, developed as a compilation of the EDAB 6808 B.Com Hons Business and Financial Analytics module. This collection of assignments showcases my proficiency in extracting meaningful, strategic insights from complex data across various domains.

The portfolio emphasizes advanced analytical techniques, predictive modelling, probabilistic inference, anomaly detection and strict adherence to data ethics.

**🛠️Core Analytical Toolkit & Expertise**

| Domain | Key Skills Demonstrated | Strategic Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Preparation & EDA** | Data cleaning, transformation, outlier identification, distribution analysis, and data visualisation. | Uncovering hidden patterns and ensuring data readiness for advanced modelling. |
| **Time Series & ML Modelling** | Cross-correlation, Granger Causality, KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost Regressors. | Forecasting, lead-lag indicator identification, and building robust predictive systems. |
| **Probabilistic Models** | Bayesian Networks, Probabilistic Graphical Models, and Conditional Probability Calculation. | Inference, modelling complex relationships, and developing robust decision support systems. |
| **Synthetic Data Generation** | SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), ML-based Imputation, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for Tabular Data. | Managing class imbalances.|
| **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modelling, and Text Preprocessing. | Analysing unstructured data (social media) to extract sentiment and dominant themes. |
| **Discourse Structure Analysis** | Knowledge mapping using NetworkX, visualisation of discourse flows, and sentiment-topic linking. | Identifying central arguments or clusters, understanding polarisation or contradictions, and mapping key themes in public dialogue. |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Building ensemble models | Identifying anomalies in time-series data. |


**🎯Portfolio Structure & Assignments**

The repository is structured around five assignments, each addressing a specialised analytical problem. Each project directory contains a dedicated README detailing the problem, methodology, results, and recommendations:

| Assignment | Focus Area | Objective Highlight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Assignment 1** | Time Series & Machine Learning | Investigating **Google Trends as a lead-lag indicator** for JSE stock price movements. |
| **Assignment 2** | Bayesian Networks & Synthetic Data | Evaluating the impact of data balancing methods (**SMOTE, GAN**) on **purchase intention prediction**. |
| **Assignment 3** | Advanced Probabilistic Inference | Performing **demographic profiling** of purchase intent using **conditional probabilities** across balanced and unbalanced Bayesian Networks. |
| **Assignment 4** | NLP & Discourse Mapping | Extracting and interpreting the **underlying structure and sentiment** of online social media discourse. |
| **Assignment 5** | Anomaly Detection | Building an ensemble model to identify anomalies in time-series data. |
